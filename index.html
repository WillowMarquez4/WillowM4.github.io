        <p> Let me introduce myself, I am a 23 year old with a mild addiction to chantilly cake. I have 3 pets, a dog (Tattoo), a leopard gecko (Mitski),
            and finally a hermit crab (Hermie). I have many hobbies pretty much anything from sewing to bug taxidermy. I have been a pharmacy tech for 
            nearly 5 years and take a lot of pride in my job. I am looking forward to learning as much as I can this semester! </p>
